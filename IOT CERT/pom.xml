As you all have heard, my time with SNDK is coming to an end today is my last day:no_mouth: before I leave, I want to let you all know how much I've enjoyed my time working with this company. This is an incredible company and I feel fortunate to have been a part of it hopefully will cross our path very soon:four_leaf_clover: Its been a great pleasure working with each one of you. A special thanks to @Brijesh Patel ‚Äç  for being such a great personality and a good mentor. Stay in touch and stay safe guys.
